# Java Notes

Check, but I don't think that local variables are given default values, but globals and class fields are!?


In line with IEEE standards float and double don't have divide by zero errors (but integer types do). Instead they have value of `Infinity`, which can be tested using `Float.isInfinite()` or `Double.isInfinite()` method or static method.

## Java Reflection

getClass()

Class.class.getDeclaredMethods() see https://stackoverflow.com/q/20366327/2762964

also getDeclaredFields()

what about getMethods
